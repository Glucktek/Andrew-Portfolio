### Kubernetes, But Make It Snack-Sized&#x20;

I love Kubernetes, and I absolutely love pie. However, let's be real here, if you tried to run Kubernetes on a stack of raspberry pis, they would be more stuffed than me at thanksgiving dinner. Your poor little SBCs start sweating, and no way to loosen the belt.

Enter k3s. The lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution that’s so slim, it would make a fashion model feel inadequate. Designed by Rancher, k3s is just like Kubernetes: same power, way less bloat.

### Why k3s Rocks My (and Your) Socks off

* Tiny Footprint: k3s is a single binary under 100MB. It’s like Kubernetes, but on a diet.
* Fast and Furious: Installs in under a minute, even on a Pi. You’ll spend more time making coffee.
* Low Resource Usage: Perfect for ARM devices and low-power hardware. Your Pis will thank you.
* Batteries Included: Comes with containerd, Flannel, Traefik, and more, but you can swap them out if you’re picky.
* Certified K8s: It’s not a toy. k3s passes all CNCF conformance tests. You get the real deal.

What Can You Do With a Pi Cluster Running k3s?

* Home automation (Home Assistant, Node-RED, etc.)
* Self-hosted services (Nextcloud, Gitea, Jellyfin, Immich)
* Learning and experimentation (CI/CD, GitOps, edge computing)
* Bragging rights at your next nerd meetup

### How to Use k3s on a Raspberry Pi Cluster

What You’ll Need

* 2+ Raspberry Pis (any model works, but 4 or newer is best)
* SD cards or USB to SSD (Recommended)
* Network (wired is best, but WiFi works)
* SSH access to each Pi
* A little patience and a lot of coffee

Step 1: Prep Your Pis

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (or your favorite flavor) onto each SD card.
2. Enable SSH by dropping an empty file named `ssh` in the `/boot` partition.
3. Boot up and SSH in to each Pi.
4. Update everything (because you’re not a monster):

   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
5. Set hostnames so you know who’s who:

   ```sh
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname pi-master
   # or pi-node1, pi-node2, etc.
   ```
6. Reboot for good measure.

Step 2: Install k3s on the Master Node

On your “master” Pi (let’s call it `pi-master`):

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

This installs k3s and starts the server.
Grab the node token for your agents:

```sh
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

Step 3: Install k3s on the Worker Nodes

On each worker Pi:

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<MASTER_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<NODE_TOKEN> sh -
```

Replace `<MASTER_IP>` with your master’s IP.
Replace `<NODE_TOKEN>` with the token you copied.

Step 4: Check Your Cluster

Back on the master:

```sh
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
```

You should see all your Pis listed as happy, ready nodes. If not, check your network/firewall and make sure the token/IPs are correct.

Step 5: Deploy Something Cool

Let’s deploy a classic Nginx pod:

```sh
sudo k3s kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
sudo k3s kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

Find the NodePort:

```sh
sudo k3s kubectl get svc
```

Now hit your Pi’s IP at that port in your browser. Boom! You’re running Kubernetes on a cluster of $35 computers. You absolute legend.

### Final Thoughts

k3s makes Kubernetes accessible, fun, and practical for tinkerers, homelabbers, and edge deployments. Running it on a Raspberry Pi cluster is a fantastic way to learn, experiment, and build cool stuff without breaking the bank or your brain.

So go forth, cluster up, and may your pods always be healthy and your nodes never taint(ed).
