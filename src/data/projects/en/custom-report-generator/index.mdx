title: Custom CI/CD Report Generator (Magnit)
description: Python-based report generator that unified disparate YAML outputs from open-source quality tools, validated and normalized the data, and produced fast, static HTML dashboards with pagination, search, and severity filtering-deployed via GitLab CI and served on GitLab Pages.

### Problem

Engineering and management needed actionable visibility into code quality findings (bugs, security issues, and hygiene)
without buying a commercial platform. We had several open-source tools producing useful reports, but each emitted
different YAML structures; making aggregation and comparison hard. Raw YAML data also does not provide a very great
experience for understanding the information. 

### Approach

A Python report generator ran as a dedicated job in GitLab CI. The pipeline stayed simple and transparent so developers could reason about and maintain it:

- Normalize: Parse each tool’s YAML and map fields into a shared schema (category, severity, file, line, rule, message, tags, timestamps).
- Validate: Enforce schema and types; gracefully flag and skip malformed records while surfacing counts in the summary.
- Convert: Write normalized artifacts to a compact JSON bundle for in-browser consumption and to pre-rendered HTML for immediate viewing.
- Generate: Produce static HTML pages with lightweight, modern CSS and a simple component structure.

### UX and performance

- Simple links and CSS-driven active states simulate SPA-like navigation, keeping the site fast and accessible without a framework.
- Normalized data and user preferences (selected filters, page size) are stored in the browser to speed reloads.
- Pagination and a debounced search keep large reports responsive.
- No UI libraries—just a few kilobytes of vanilla JS for required interactivity.

### CI/CD and hosting

- The pipeline step validates inputs, generates artifacts, and publishes the static site to GitLab Pages.
- Produced artifacts include normalized JSON, per-tool diagnostics, and the HTML/CSS/JS bundle.
- Summary stats are exposed to later stages and merges (e.g., total issues, severity distribution) to enable simple quality gates.

### What was delivered

- A consistent, comparable view of issues across multiple tools without a paid product.
- A fast, portable reporting site that works on any static host.
- Clear guardrails for data quality, keeping the pipeline resilient even when upstream report formats change.

### Why this project stands out

This work balanced impact and simplicity: organization-wide visibility delivered through a small, robust Python pipeline that normalized messy inputs, generated fast static dashboards, and shipped through CI without vendor lock-in or runtime overhead. Frameworks were deliberately avoided—just efficient HTML/CSS/JS and client-side storage—so large reports feel instant while keeping the system easy to maintain.
