### Problem

Engineering and management needed actionable visibility into code quality findings (bugs, security issues, and hygiene)
without buying a commercial platform. We had several open-source tools producing useful reports, but each emitted
different YAML structures; making aggregation and comparison hard. Raw YAML data also does not provide a very great
experience for understanding the information. 

### Approach

I built a Python report generator that ran as a dedicated job in GitLab CI. I kept the pipeline simple and transparent so developers could reason about and maintain it:

- Normalize: I parsed each tool’s YAML and mapped fields into a shared schema (category, severity, file, line, rule, message, tags, timestamps).
- Validate: I enforced schema and types and gracefully flagged and skipped malformed records while surfacing counts in the summary.
- Convert: I wrote normalized artifacts to a compact JSON bundle for in-browser consumption and to pre-rendered HTML for immediate viewing.
- Generate: I produced static HTML pages with lightweight, modern CSS and a simple component structure.

### UX and performance

- I used simple links and CSS-driven active states to simulate SPA-like navigation, which kept the site fast and accessible without a framework.
- I stored normalized data and user preferences (selected filters, page size) in the browser to speed reloads.
- I added pagination and a debounced search to keep large reports responsive.
- I avoided UI libraries on purpose—just a few kilobytes of vanilla JS for the interactivity I needed.

### CI/CD and hosting

- I wired the pipeline step to validate inputs, generate artifacts, and publish the static site to GitLab Pages.
- I produced artifacts like normalized JSON, per-tool diagnostics, and the HTML/CSS/JS bundle.
- I exposed summary stats to later stages and merges (e.g., total issues, severity distribution) to enable simple quality gates.

### What I delivered

- I gave the team a consistent, comparable view of issues across multiple tools without a paid product.
- I built a fast, portable reporting site that works on any static host.
- I added clear guardrails for data quality, keeping the pipeline resilient even when upstream report formats change.

### Why this project stands out to me

I like how this balances impact and simplicity: organization-wide visibility delivered through a small, robust Python pipeline that normalized messy inputs, generated fast static dashboards, and shipped through CI without vendor lock-in or runtime overhead. I deliberately avoided frameworks—just efficient HTML/CSS/JS and client-side storage—so large reports feel instant while keeping the system easy to maintain.
