### Overview

This portfolio is built to the same production standards I use for client work: fast, accessible, and maintainable, with a clean content pipeline and automated deployment. It uses Astro with TypeScript and MDX content collections to keep content structured and portable, Tailwind CSS to keep styles consistent and lean, and a light i18n framework to support localized data and text translations.

The project integrates SEO fundamentals (structured data, canonical and hreflang tags, RSS), performance-conscious images with `astro:assets`, and a component library emphasizing semantic HTML.

### Architecture highlights

- Framework: Astro for hybrid-SSR/static output, islands where needed, and zero-JS-by-default pages.
- Language and tooling: TypeScript with strictness, ESLint 9, and Prettier to keep the codebase consistent and safe.
- Content: Astro Content Collections for project/blog data with schemas; MDX for rich content; predictable routes and slugs.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with a minimal global layer and utility-first components; careful focus states and keyboard navigation.
- i18n: Data translations via `src/config/translationData.json.ts` and route translations; locale-aware utilities and
  link generation. This will support future growth if this site needs to reach non-english speaking audiences.
- Performance: Static-first pages, small islands, optimized images, and tidy CSS. Avoids client runtime JS unless necessary.

### Deployment and operations

This site ships through a GitOps pipeline:

- PR previews: Each pull request generates an ephemeral preview site for content and UI review.
- Merge-to-main deploy: Merging triggers an automated build and deploy via Coolify on my VPS.
- Ingress: The app runs behind Traefik (per-environment/domain separation). Traefik handles routing, middlewares, and TLS at the edge via Cloudflare.
- Exposure: Cloudflare Tunnels terminate at the edge; no ports are opened to the internet and the origin IP remains private.
- Reliability: Monitoring notifies on deploys and health; backups align with my broader platform posture (object storage via Cloudflare R2 for artifacts/state where applicable). 

### Developer experience

- Automated formatting, linting, and type safety make content edits low-risk and fast.
- Content authorship uses predictable MDX + schema-driven frontmatter, so adding projects or blog posts remains frictionless.
- Aliased imports and clear folder structure keep components discoverable and decoupled.

### Why this project stands out to me

It’s a practical demonstration of end-to-end product thinking: strong foundations (a11y, SEO, perf), clean content workflows, and a secure GitOps deployment model on a hardened VPS—no exposed ports, Cloudflare edge protections, and Traefik policy control. It also shows restraint: minimal JS on the client, right-sized automation, and infrastructure that can scale without adding avoidable complexity.
